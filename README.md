## AngularGroupSelect

This is a custom component that extends mat-select functionality. It's a selection dropdown that can contain grouped elements (mat-optgroup) but if the component receives only one group it will be a simple dropdown. The component implements ControlValueAccessor so it can be use in any forms.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
